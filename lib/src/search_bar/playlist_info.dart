/**
 * TODO: Create a widget that receives a playlist object.
 * It shows the title, and favorite buttons.
 * When the favorite buttons are pressed and the final data changes,
 * it must trigger a callback to the parent.
 * 
 * Then, the favorite playlist count must be updated on the parent, because it
 * has to be changed to a "state" (that's the only way to trigger an update).
 * 
 * It could simply be a stateless widget and then pass the "isFavorite" from above.
 * In that case, the parent should keep the full list of favorites (in order to get the specific IDs).
